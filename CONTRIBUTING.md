## Contributing

We welcome community contributions to this project.

For more information on how to contribute to Ambient, please [consult the book](https://ambientrun.github.io/Ambient/community/contributing.html).

Please talk with us on Discord beforehand if you'd like to contribute a larger piece of work. This is particularly important if your contribution involves adding new functionality to the host; our goal is to implement as much functionality on the guest as possible, so that the host can remain simple and enable a wide variety of use cases without being too opinionated.
