# Examples

These are examples of Ambient embers written in the Rust programming language.

Note that they must be run with a matching version of the runtime - if you're using a 0.1.1 runtime, you must use the 0.1.1 examples, and vice versa.

You may encounter unexpected behaviour if you attempt to run the latest versions of the examples (i.e. `HEAD`/`main`) with an older runtime.

# Windows

Provided you have ambient runtime installed on your windows machine, you can use run_samples.bat to list, build and run the examples
